This project centers around the efficient hosting of a website by harnessing the capabilities of Terraform, a robust infrastructure-as-code tool. The primary objective is to automate the provisioning of resources needed for hosting, ensuring a seamless and reproducible deployment process. Leveraging Terraform scripts, the infrastructure components are precisely defined, allowing for the systematic creation and configuration of resources. The chosen provider for this deployment is AWS, reflecting the project's flexibility and scalability in a cloud environment.

In the version control and deployment workflow, Linux commands and the Git Bash terminal are employed, providing a standardized and efficient approach to managing code changes and orchestrating the deployment process. The choice of Sublime Text Editor enhances code editing efficiency, enabling developers to work seamlessly with Terraform scripts and configurations.

A noteworthy aspect of the project is the incorporation of a web file designed for downloading the necessary packages required for the website. This ensures that the deployment process is not only automated but also includes the essential dependencies, streamlining the setup and enhancing the overall reliability of the hosted website. The synergy between Terraform, AWS, Git Bash, and Sublime Text Editor creates a powerful and automated pipeline for hosting websites, showcasing the efficacy of infrastructure-as-code in modern development practices.
